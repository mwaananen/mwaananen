# Mark R. Waananen - Prospective Data Analyst
As a professional I have worked primarily in retail and sales, but am hoping to make a career pivot into Data Analytics. I recently completed a 24 week [Bootcamp course on Data Visualization and Analytics](https://bootcamp.umn.edu/data/). Throughout this course we learned Excel, VBA, Python, SQL, Tableau, Machine Learning. We worked primarily in Jupyter Notebook using various Python libraries such as, Pandas, MatPlotLib, Numpy, among others. 
### My career objectives:
+ Obtain employment as Data Analyst or within a data related field
+ Obtain employment as a career, __Not__ just a job
+ Use data and data related sciences for good causes
+ Have the ability work remotely, with the intention of traveling
+ Focus on building data visualizations and data cleaning
